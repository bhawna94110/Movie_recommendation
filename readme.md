This recommendation system is made on 4000+ movies features. After pre-processing of all features converted them into CountVectorizer vector. Then applying cosine similarity between these vectors and filtering top 5 similar vectors. Then fetching top 5 movies image from tmbdAPI and integrating them with streamlit. For better understanding look at below demo.
